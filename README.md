# MyLinuxScripts
Scripts and dotfiles for my person computer. (hyprland, waybar, configuration files). Only intended for my personal use to keep my files synced between my desktop and laptop.

The `tool` file is a program that helps with uploading this and spreading it. Might delete your whole system so don't use it.
